Then to get the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 we would make the call `sum_1_to_n(10)`. Another way we could think about this sum is that it is `10 + sum_1_to_n(9)`.  Now, that seems a little silly... but it is actually a really clever trick that makes it easier to think about writing recursive functions.\n",
